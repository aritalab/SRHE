# SRHE

This is an experimental implementation of the decomposition ring based homomorphic encryption scheme, which is proposed in [^AH2017] and [^AH2020].


## Prerequesites

- GNU Make (make)
- GNU C++ Compiler (g++)
- GNU Multi-Precision Library (GMP)
- Number Theory Library (NTL)


## Instructions for building and testing programs

1. Get these source files and into the directory.

```
cd SRHE
```

2. Compile test programs (Note: make sure your library path including GMP and NTL).

```
make
```

3. Run the test programs.

```
./nsgenTest
```

or

```
./ringTest
```

or

```
./sheTest
```
